# Heart-Stroke-Predictor
**Problem Statement :**

In this project, I will be performing a classification analysis to predict the likelihood of a patient suffering a stroke. This binary classification problem involves using multiple numerical and categorical features such as age, hypertension, work type, residence type, marital status, BMI, smoking status, gender, and heart disease. The objective is to develop a model that can accurately classify patients as either at risk or not at risk for a stroke. By understanding the key factors that contribute to stroke risk, healthcare providers can implement targeted prevention strategies and personalized care plans. This project is crucial for improving patient outcomes, enhancing preventive healthcare measures, and optimizing resource allocation in the medical field.

**Aim :**

To classify / predict whether a patient can suffer a stroke.
It is a binary classification problem with multiple numerical and categorical features.
